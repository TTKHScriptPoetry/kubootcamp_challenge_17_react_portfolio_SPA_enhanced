          This About Me section is just simply and technically informative: like many others who took online school during the pandemics, I went for an intensive 24-week long Fullstack Coding Bootcamp program with KU (the Univerity of Kansas) and just happen to have finished it recently.

        <p className="about-me mb-1">  
          As someone who had web programming background in Microsoft .Net environment, taking the bootcamp training was not much of a challenge; it's like re-encoutering an old book, but full of tricks and insights this time around in its newest edition, as far as the front-end programming in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery is concerned.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p className="about-me mb-1">  
          I'm here to re-iterating the remaining skillset that the Bootcamps has offered me through the online exhibition of my work during its training as a self-reflection. The focus of my portfolio is on MERN stack, at the minimum relevance, all projects were based off of Node.js/Express.js Visual Code IDE environment.
